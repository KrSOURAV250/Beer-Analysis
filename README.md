**Description:**

This project provides a well-structured workflow for executing a series of Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) in a specific order. The `main.ipynb` file serves as the entry point, and subsequent files should be run in the sequence outlined within each notebook.

**Instructions:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have a Jupyter Notebook environment set up. If not, please refer to the official documentation for installation instructions: [https://jupyter.org/install](https://jupyter.org/install)

2. **Initial Execution:**
   - Open the `main.ipynb` file in your Jupyter Notebook environment.
   - Run all code cells within `main.ipynb` sequentially.

3. **Subsequent Files:**
   - After successfully running `main.ipynb`, follow the specific instructions provided at the end of each subsequent notebook file for the correct execution order. These instructions will guide you on the appropriate files to run next.

**Organization:**

The project is organized with the `main.ipynb` file acting as the starting point. Each following notebook file should be designed to rely on the outputs or configurations established in the files executed before it.#
